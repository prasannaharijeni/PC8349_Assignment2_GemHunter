**GEM HUNTERS**

Game Elements:

Players: Player 1 starts in the top-left corner, and Player 2 starts in the bottom-right corner.

Gems: Randomly placed on the board at the start of the game. They do not move once placed.

Obstacles: Random positions on the board (e.g., represented by an "O") that players cannot pass
through.

Rules:

 Display
The board will be displayed after every turn. Players will be represented by P1 and P2, gems by G, obstacles by O, and empty spaces by -.

 Movement:
Players input their movement through the console: U for up, D for down, L for left, R for right.
Players can move up, down, left, or right by one square on their turn.
Players cannot move diagonally.
Players cannot move onto or through squares with obstacles.

 Collecting Gems:
If a player moves onto a square containing a gem, they collect it.
The gem is removed from the board (the square becomes empty).

 Turns:
Players alternate turns.
Each player gets 15 turns. The game ends after 30 moves (15 turns for each player).

 Winning:
The player with the most gems collected after all turns are exhausted wins.
If both players have the same number of gems, it's a tie.
